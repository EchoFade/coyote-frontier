Welcome to my thoughts file! MY THOGUHTS ON KEANU REEVES

Here are the ways the game interacts with RPI:
1. Though chat actions
    - When someone says or emotes something, it logs it to give a FlatRate
2. Through discrete actions
    - This also gives a FlatRate, modified by the taxBracket
3. Through continuous actions
    - This gives a modifier to the next Payward

**Chat actions**
- These are actions that are logged when a player says something in chat or performs an emote.
- Most give more money if its a longer message, some also give more money if there are other people around
- These use a FlatRate as the base, modified by taxBracket, multiplied by length and poeople around

**Discrete actions**
- These are actions that are logged when a player performs a specific action, like mining a rock
- These use a FlatRate as the base, modified by taxBracket
- Amount is usually determined by the system calling the action

**Continuous actions**
- These are things that track time spent doing them, like being close to a pirate or flying a ship
- These have a goal amount both FlatRate and Modifier, which accumulate over a period of time
- The resulting payward is calculated and locked in at the next Payward, then reset


**Proximity Continuous Actions**
- Handled by a ProximitySystem that does all the checking for components and distance
- Determined with two types of component:
    - A monolithic component that holds the component tags to check for, along with the relevant data
    - A marker component that just marks an entity as something to check proximity against
- The ProxyLiker component is added by jobs to players
